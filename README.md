# Go URL Crawler

## Overview

The Go URL Crawler is a lightweight web crawler written in GoLang. It is designed to recursively crawl web pages, extract URLs, and provide insights into the structure of a website.

## Features

- **URL Normalization:** Normalize URLs by converting pathnames to lowercase and handling trailing slashes.
- **HTTP Fetching:** Retrieves HTML content from web pages using the standard `net/http` package.
- **Error Handling:** Provides detailed error messages for fetch failures, HTTP errors, and HTML parsing errors.
- **Content Type Validation:** Ensures that the fetched content is of type "text/html" before proceeding with URL extraction.
- **Recursive Crawling:** Continues to crawl extracted URLs to build a comprehensive map of the website structure.
